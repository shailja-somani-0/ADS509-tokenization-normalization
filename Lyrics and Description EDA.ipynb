    "Q: Why is it beneficial to use assertion statements in your code? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: There are a variety of reasons that it's beneficial to use assertion statements in our code, including the following:\n",
    "* Check that assumptions you made remain true. For example, if you expect a parameter fed in to be a string, but it's an int, an assert condition could check if it's a string and assert an error if not (Ramos, n.d.). \n",
    "* Assertion statements also make debugging easier by triggering alarms if there is a bug and explaining where and what that bug is, based on how specific your assertion statement may be (Ramos, n.d.).\n",
    "* If you have multiple assertion statements throughout your code that verify assumptions are being met, the code is progressing as expected, etc, if there is a bug, you may be able to easier pinpoint it by knowing where the last successful checkpoint was by seeing what the last successful assertion statement was (Ramos, n.d.). \n",
    "* Assertion statements can be disabled as a group, so they can be easily disabled in a Prod environment without removing them from your code altogether. This allows them to still remain in your dev code for future testing, but not show up in your prod environment (Jones, n.d.).\n",
